First Repository: Personal Voice Assistant, referencing tutorial

This voice assistance can understand a few basic phrases and respond accordingly.

My hope is to build upon it over time, making it faster, more streamline, and robust.

Any and all comments are welcome, I am open to learning and am just getting started in my IT venture.
